# 10Alytics-Project-on-Hand-Detection-in-Computer-Vision
Computer vision is an essential artificial intelligence (AI) landscape aspect.

Hand detection can be used as a form of communication, Sign language, and hand gesture control. This is an asset, and I enjoyed working on this project.
Thanks to 10Alytics for making this happen.

Tools Used: Jupyter notebook, cv2, and MediaPipe libraries
